# equipment-mangement-prototype
A little prototype version of an attempt at an equipment mangement software in python using some light OOP, within this project i aimed to make use of all the major features of OOP in a meaningful way.
this porject now functions as intended, but this is a program in it most rudimentry form, and is susceptible to many user input errors.
This was built in visual studios and should be able to run on most hardware
The main modified code and the classes will need to be downloaded the classes have been placed in seperate .py files to allow for easier mangement.
